# fetch-data

This is a React coding exercise in fetching data from a web api endpoint. We're using the HackerNews API with a default search term of "OpenAI", and paginating at every 10 items.

It uses a bootstrap library for styling modified by a css file, and uses the Axios library for fetching and transforming the data.

### enhancements

- Some minor formatting changes were added for better readibility via css
- Changed the default search term from "MIT" to "OpenAPI"

### planned improvements

- The number of returned items per page is hard coded to 10. A planned addition is a field for submission of preferred maximum number of items per page
- The addition of a search field to change the search term and returned links
- Further UI enhancements through changes to the buttons and colors
